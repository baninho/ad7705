Test / demo program for the AD7705
==================================

This program switches on the clock from the RPI, 
triggers a calibration of the AD, 
reads data from channel 1 and 
prints it on the screen.

This program uses DRDY connected to Port 22 and
waits for a falling edge on this port to read
the data. This is done via interrupts / poll
so that this process sleeps until new data becomes
available.

Make sure you use the new PCB layout from:
http://web.eng.gla.ac.uk/rpi/
which has the interrupt wired up.


To build:

    make

Run it with the command:

    sudo ./ad7705_test
